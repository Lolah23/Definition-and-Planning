##  Qualitative Assessment

###  Basic Structure and Architecture – Grade 5

#### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend:** React.js SPA (Single Page Application)
- **Backend:** RESTful API with Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **NFC Integration:** Web NFC API simulation (for development) or physical NFC reader
- **Documentation:**  
  - `README.md` includes setup instructions, stack overview, and architecture diagram  
  - All major components, routes, and data flows are diagrammed and commented

---

###  Functionalities – Grade 5

| Feature | Implemented? | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Teacher Course Creation |  | Teachers can create new courses with title, code, and description |
| Session Scheduling |  | Sessions are linked to courses with date/time |
| NFC Student Tap-in |  | NFC ID and timestamp are recorded to the database |
| Automated Hours Calculation |  | Duration calculated based on session start/end and attendance tap time |
| Attendance History |  | Teachers can view per-course attendance logs |
| Real-time Updates |  | WebSocket or polling updates attendance view in real-time |

---

###  Code Quality and Documentation – Grade 5

- Follows a clear folder structure: `/components`, `/routes`, `/services`, etc.
- Inline comments are present to explain logic in modules
- ESLint enforces code style; Prettier used for consistent formatting

**Example:**

```js
// POST /api/attendance
// Records student NFC tap-in
app.post("/api/attendance", async (req, res) => {
  const { studentId, sessionId, timestamp } = req.body;
  // Save record to DB
  ...
});
Testing and Error Handling – Grade 5
Unit Testing: Jest for backend logic

Frontend Testing: React Testing Library

Error Handling:

React error boundaries

Backend checks for invalid data, NFC mismatches, unauthorized access
Code here
if (!studentId || !sessionId) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing required data" });
}
User Interface and Interaction – Grade 5
Teacher dashboard includes side navigation, modals, and success toasts

Student view is mobile-responsive for NFC tap-in

Sample UI Components:

CourseID.jsx – Displays course info

AttendanceTable.jsx – Paginated list of attendance logs
