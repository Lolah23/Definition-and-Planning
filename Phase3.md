# TAPIN Project â€“ Phase 3: Further Development Report

## Introduction
This phase focuses on further development of the TAPIN attendance management system by enhancing the user experience, extending functionality, and improving the system based on earlier phases.

The main functionalities already working (based on the recorded session and Phase 2 development) include:

- **Teacher Login**: Ability to log in using NFC tags.
- **Session Creation**: Teachers can create new sessions.
- **Student Tap-in**: Students can mark attendance by tapping NFC.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Real-time tracking of sessions and attendance counts.

The starting point for further development is based on the use cases from Phase 1 and the backend system from Phase 2.

## Current Status

### Functionalities Implemented:
- Teacher creates and manages sessions.
- Students tap NFC cards to mark attendance.
- Attendance records are automatically updated.
- Login and session information are stored and retrieved correctly.
- Real-time updates via SignalR Hubs.
- Backend configured with authentication (JWT) and API documentation (Swagger).

## Areas for Further Development

| Area | Description | Priority |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **User Experience** | Improve mobile responsiveness for student tap-in view. | High |
| **Session Management** | Add functionality for teachers to edit or cancel sessions. | Medium |
| **Attendance History** | Allow teachers to download attendance logs as CSV or PDF reports. | High |
| **Authentication Handling** | Improve error messages on login failures (e.g., wrong NFC tag). | Medium |
| **Security Optimization** | Shorten JWT token expiry time for enhanced security. | Medium |
| **System Management** | Administrator portal improvements (e.g., manage users, reset sessions). | Low |

## Issues Identified

**Missing:**
- No "Edit Session" or "Delete Session" feature for teachers yet.
- Limited mobile optimization on student tap-in page.

**Works but Needs Finishing:**
- Downloadable attendance reports feature for teachers.
- Advanced error handling when NFC tap-in fails.

**Improvements Needed:**
- Streamline loading times after NFC tap.
- Better UI feedback (loading spinners, success messages).

## Next Steps (Plan)
- Implement a responsive redesign for tap-in screens (student view).
- Add ability for teachers to modify or cancel sessions after creation.
- Allow teachers to download attendance reports.
- Refactor error handling to provide clearer feedback.
- Tune authentication settings for enhanced security.
